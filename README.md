Typing Speed Test Project - 100DaysOfCode

The project is easy to use, built on Python and GUI is from the Tkinter Module
To get started, all you have to do is fork the project repo and run it on your machine/PC.

The time limit is current set to 30seconds and the words to type has already been defined. you can tweak to fit your desire.
The "Start Timer" gets the timer started and also enables typing in the Textarea. As soon as the time limit elapses, the 
Textarea is disabled.

NOTIFICATION EXPLAINED:
When the time limit elases, if the user typed in all predefined words correctly, it displayed a mesaage telling the user they
typed all the words correct but in a case where the user didn't type in all the words correctly, they are notified on
the amount of "corresponding" words they types correctly, corressponding in this case relates to the POSITION of each word in 
user's input and in the prefined text.
